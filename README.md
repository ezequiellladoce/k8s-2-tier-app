# k8s 2 tier App with a fronted Deployment and a MySQL StatefulSet as backend

In this replo we will deploy a 2 tier app. As a frontend we will use phpmyadmin with a k8s Deployment  with 3 Repliacas , the phpmyadmin wil connect to a MySQL StatefulSet as backend with 3 replicas.

The Mysql Stateful will record data persistently in a persistent volume and can replicate data to the other pods in the same StatefullSet.

A StatefulSet uses Headless service to provide the domain control of its pods.   

Secrets are used to supply sensitive information to containers.  

## Objetives

- Deploy a simple StatefulSet MySql db wit 3 replicas as a backend. 
- Add a Headless service to provide a stable domain controller of the pods.
- Use  secrets to mount the passwords in the mysql pods.
- Add a database to Mysql throw configmaps 
- Deploy a Phpmyadmin as a front end with 3 replicas.
- Add a Load balancer to the deployment
- Connect the front end Deployment with the backend StatefulSet.  
- Test the app.

## Prerequisites üìã

- A k8s cluster v1.9 or later, for testing purposes can be minikube (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/). You can check the k8s server with the command kubectl version
- kubectl configured to communicate with the cluster

## Starting üöÄ

## Repo description

- Mysql folder
  - mysql-secret.yaml this YAML is used to mount the password as a secret
  - mysql-statefulset.yaml this YAML file describes the Stateful set and associated the pods to the persisten volume
  - mysql-service.yaml this YAML provides the a load balancer service, this could be use to connect to the Mysql StatefulSet ony for reading
  - mysql-headless-service.yaml this YAML provides a Headless service to provide domain control of the pods.
  - mysql-secret.yaml this YAML provides a pod to test the connection to the MySql StatefulSet

- PhpMyadmin folder
  - php-deplyment.yaml this YAML provides the phpmyadmin Deplyment adnd connect to the Mysql deployment throu the  envs of phpmyadmin docker image

## Clone the repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/ezequiellladoce/k8s-2-tier-app.git
```

## Deploy üì¶  

Enter to the repo folder

### Create namespace

```
kubectl create namespace k8s-app

kubectl get namespace
```
### Create the secret
```
kubectl apply -f mysql-secret.yaml -n k8s-app   
secret/mysql-secret created
```
Check the secret 
```
kubectl describe secret mysql-secret -n k8s-mysql
```
You will get an output like that:
```
Name:         mysql-secret
Namespace:    k8s-mysql
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
ROOT_PASSWORD:  8 bytes
```
In this file The password were encoded in base64
```
echo -n "password" | base64
cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
And added to data in the secret.yaml file in data.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata: 
    name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
   ROOT_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=

```

### Create the Headless Service

```
kubectl -f apply service.yaml -n k8s-mysql
```
Check the service
```
kubectl describe scv svc.mysql -n k8s-mysql
```
You will get an output like that:
```
Name:              svc-mysql
Namespace:         k8s-mysql
Labels:            app=k8s-mysql
Annotations:       <none>
Selector:          app=k8s-mysql
Type:              ClusterIP
IP Family Policy:  SingleStack
IP Families:       IPv4
IP:                None
IPs:               None
Port:              tcp  3306/TCP
TargetPort:        3306/TCP
Endpoints:         <none>
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
```
A Headless service is specified with That does not allocate an IP address or forward traffic. This is specified in  the service.yaml explicitly setting ClusterIP to ‚ÄúNone‚Äù.

### Create the StatefulSet
```
kubectl apply -f statefulset.yaml -n k8s-mysql
```
Check the StatefulSet
